            <h3>Info</h3>
            <p>This was a team project developed in Unity. My roles in this project were programmer(C#) and Multiplayer Lead. This is a 4-8 player game.</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This game is a simple and fun multiplayer tag game. 1 Player is a Hunter trying to tag the other mages, steal their power, and turn them into the hunter. Each mage has a specific ability that aids them in escaping the hunter. For my programming role, I focused on creating the hunter and fire mage abilities and the sounds for all the abilities. As the multiplayer lead role I focused on getting every player to spawn in the same game with seperate controls and camera view and the scoreboard at the end that keeps track of everyone's time spent as the hunter.</p>
            <h3>Aspects of the game I am proud of?</h3>
            <p>I'm really proud that we got the multiplayer working. We took on extra challenges in player interaction and player data and were able to successfully add them into our game.</p>
            <h3>If I were to redo this what would I change?</h3>
            <p>I would add a waiting room/lobby area. Right now the players have to communicate in real life when they are all going to press play and which player is going to be the hunter so it would be nice to have that built into the game.</p>
