            <h3>Info</h3>
            <p>This was a solo project. I programmed the game in Unity (C#). It is a 1 Player game.</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a music based platformer game. Jump and shoot your way through all the obstacles in one clean attempt to win the game.</p>
            <h3>Aspects of the game I am proud of?</h3>
            <p>Two new coding concepts I learned developing this game were how to use delegates and coroutines. Delegates are very useful to connect events with actions which allowed me to sync everything with the players death and corotines allow for delay in the code allowing me to add breaks and delay for actions.</p>
            <h3>If I were to redo this what would I change?</h3>
            <p>While I am proud of how "unfloaty" I was able to get the jump, it still is a little too floaty so I would work to fix that to allow smoother jumps.</p>
