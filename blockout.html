            <h3>Info</h3>
            <p>This was a solo project. I programmed this in Unity (C#). It is a 1 Player game.</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This was one of the first games I ever built in unity. The blocks in the game are not all "tetra" meaning
                they are not all made of 4 pieces and there is an obstacle block.
                The goal of the game is to balance your time and stress levels and keep everything under control. Going
                out and activities lower stress levels but take time, and skipping activities saves time but raises
                stress levels.</p>

            <h3>Aspects of the game I am proud of?</h3>
            <p>The event system which spawns random events and then either reduces your time or speeds up the tempo
                based on your answer was completely designed by me. I enjoyed implemented that into the game.</p>

            <h3>If I were to redo this what would I change?</h3>
            <p>I think there could be a better balance between the two options. Choosing the option to skip out on events
                drastically speeds up the game and while I wanted the game difficulty to reflect the real life
                difficulty of time management<br>
                I feel I could create a better balance. I would also add a visual meter for stress levels</p>
