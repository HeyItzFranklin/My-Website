            <h3>Info</h3>
            <p>This was a group project. The game was developed in Unity. My roles were product manager, level designer (Level 3) and programmer(C#).</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Dogman is a platformer where a dog in a man's body jumps across rooftops chasing down pigeons. As the product manager I made sure everyone got their work down and worked with everyone to ensure their levels would work. I combined all of our
                projects into one and ensured a smooth transition from level to level.
            </p>
            <h3>Aspects of the game I am proud of?</h3>
            <p>In my level I designed a wrecking ball that swings down and can hit the player. I'm proud of this because I had to research a new mechanic, hinge joints, to allow the wrecking ball to have the swinging motion.</p>
            <h3>If I were to redo this what would I change?</h3>
            <p>If I had more time I would have tried to add some more interesting puzzles/obstacles in my level. I had a mechanic where the player could press shift to switch their camera angle and get a different view of the map and would have liked to play around with that more, but I had to scrap it to make sure the controls were the same for each level to not confuse the player</p>
