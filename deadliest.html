            <h3>Info</h3>
            <p>This was my team Capstone Project. It's was developed in Unity. I am the team lead and lead
                programmer(C#). This is a 1-2 player game.</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Deadliest Dance is a rhythm game with fighting game inspirations. In my opinion, fighting games
                and rhythm games have a lot in common so I wanted to find a way to fuse them together. As the team lead
                I work with every member on the team
                to plan out each person's role in the development. I also combine the assets from the two artist and the
                other programmers all into one project. My job as lead programmer is to develop the core gameplay
                including the note press detection,
                score variables, and music integration.
            </p>
            <h3>Aspects of the game I am proud of?</h3>
            <p>I coded all of the gameplay and helped with implementing UI and Animation scripts. Creating unique movesets for each character and coding the level progression timer were two of my favorite aspects.</p>
            <h3>If I were to redo this what would I change ?</h3>
            <p>The biggest lesson I learned from this project is how important it is to check in with every member on the team to make sure everyone is on the same page. This project was developed entirely during quarantine so learning how to communicate solely online was a challenge but an important skill to learn.</p>
